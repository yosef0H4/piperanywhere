She sells seashells on the seashore
But the value of these shells will fall
Due to the laws of supply and demand
No one wants to buy shells 'cause there's loads on the sand
Step one, you must create a sense of scarcity
Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare, you see
Bear with me, take as many shells as you can find and hide 'em on an island
Stockpile 'em high until theyâ€™re rarer than a diamond
Step two, gotta make the people think that they want 'em
Really want 'em, really fuckin' want 'em, hit 'em like Bronson
Influencers, product placement, featured prime time entertainment
If you haven't got a shell, then you're just a fucking waste, man
Three, it's monopoly, invest inside some property
Start a corporation, make a logo, do it properly
"Shells must sell", that will be your new philosophy
Swallow all your morals, they're a poor man's quality
Four, expand, expand, expand
Clear forest, make land, fresh blood on hands
Five, why just shells? Why limit yourself?
She sells seashells, sell oil as well
Six, guns, sell stocks, sell diamonds, sell rocks
Sell water to a fish, sell the time to a clock
Seven, press on the gas, take your foot off the brakes
Then run to be the president of the United States
Eight, big smile, mate, big wave, that's great
Now the truth is overrated, tell lies out the gate
Nine, polarize the people, controversy is the game
It don't matter if they hate you if they all say your name
Ten, the world is yours
Step out on a stage to a round of applause
You're a liar, a cheat, a devil, a whore
And you sell seashells on the seashore
